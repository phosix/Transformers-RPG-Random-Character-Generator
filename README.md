# Transformers RPG Random Character Generator
A Random Character generator designed for use with the official Transformers RPG.
===
A solo, unaffiliated fan-project, this BASH script generates a random Transformers character.
Stats are randomly assigned, influences are randomly assigned, origins are randomly assigned, etc.

There is a 50% chance of having more than one Influence, and a 33% chance of getting a third Influence.

Skills are randomly assigned, but Specializations are limited to a 50% chance from the appropriate Role list and Influence perks.

Internal Hardpoints are randomly assigned.
* Standard and Non-Weapon Internal Hardpoints can both be assigned non-weapon equipment
* Reinforced hardpoints only get assigned appropriate weapons

External Hardpoint (carried) equipment gaind as part of a perk are tracked and listed.
The remaining External Hardpoint gear is not yet generated.
